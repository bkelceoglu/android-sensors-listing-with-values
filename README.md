This simple project is to list sensors in your android device.
It lists and shows current values in single page. However, since a lot sensors presents in 
standart android devices, displaying all values in a single page consumes a lot of cpu and memory.

For this, instead of adding this to real device i suggest you to use virtual devices.

On the other hand, you can still use it on real android devices if you only click on single item
on list in main page.


Have fun!
