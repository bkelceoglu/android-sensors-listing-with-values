This simple project is to list sensors in your android device.
It lists and shows current values in single page. However, since a lot sensors presents in 
standart android devices, displaying all values in a single page consumes a lot of cpu and memory.

Instead of adding this to real device i suggest you to use virtual devices.

Have fun!
